# Tried background normalization - was a lot more skew in the MA plot that follows with background than full, particularly at those peaks with low read counts. Not sure why this difference exists since the two settings are meant to be proxies for each other but move forward with this method. Also go back to the MB and SN4741 comparison and change normalization to match. Since there were no explicit comparisons, didn't look at the MA plot up there, but expect the normalization to have behaved similiarly. Keep it consistent.
